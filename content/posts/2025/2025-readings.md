[Psalm 72; Daniel 2:24-49; Ephesians 5:15-20](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+72%3B+Daniel+2%3A24-49%3B+Ephesians+5%3A15-20)

Contrasting wisdom:

- Psalm of Solomon seeking justice and prosperity for his people but also threaded with vanity of Solomon as the agent (eg v8-11)
- In contrast Daniel is at pains to say only God has the wisdom to interpret the dreaam (v27-28a)
- In Ephesians, Paul commends what might be seen as a practical wisdom ('making the most of every opportunity because the days are evil' v16) but it too derives from the inspiration of the Spirit.

Holy Spirit grant me this wisdom, today especially, keep me thankful and help me navigate this life.

> ^21^ Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behaviour.
> ^22^ But now he has reconciled you by Christ’s physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation –
> ^23^ if you continue in your faith, established and firm, and do not move from the hope held out in the gospel. 
-- [Colossians 1:21-23a]https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201%3A19-23&version=NIVUK)

Jesus, this is my hope, let it be so and help me I beg to not move from it.
