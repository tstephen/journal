Hi Matthew   
  
I  spotted this project and thought it'd be the sort of thing I'd very  much be up for, though I am in contact, probably till around April. I've  done architecture roles at a couple of government departments and I  also did a carbon reporting project for the nhs.  
  
 Is  it worth having a chat in case something similar comes up? I hit that  'interest' button but I doubt you have time to pay attention to all of  those.   
  
Let's talk
