Dear Hiring Manager,


Experienced *Lead Backend Developer* with deep expertise in *Python*, *Java*, and *AWS*, I’ve led Agile teams delivering scalable, cloud-native systems for clients including UK government, and the NHS. At Elsevier, I've rounded out my experience with both Lambda and Kubernetes deployments on AWS.

My prior work with the NHS directly supported *carbon reduction* goals, aligning closely with your mission around sustainable logistics.

I offer hands-on DevOps, strong architectural design, and *full SDLC* ownership—from API design to CI/CD and production scaling—with leadership experience in high-impact environments.


Kind regards,

*Tim Stephenson*
