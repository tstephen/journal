Good morning,

I read with interest this Senior Software Engineer / Python Developer position. 

I _do_ have the strong backend Python you're seeking along with solid AWS experience. And I have worked full-stack too, though the emphasis on backend is right for me.

Machine Learning and AI are areas we are exploring in my current role at Elsevier, so without over-stating it that could fit too. And obviously I have some medical context from work at Elsevier and NHS England.

Let's talk, hopefully this could be a good fit.

Best, +
