Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm a Senior Python Developer with 10+ years of experience delivering scalable, cloud-based systems using *Django*, *FastAPI*, and *SQL*. At Elsevier, I led backend development of AWS-hosted services with *CI/CD*, *Docker*, and *Terraform*, improving performance and reliability.

Previously, I delivered secure Django platforms for UK government and NHS clients, supporting critical services and *carbon reduction goals*.

With an *MEng from the University of Manchester* and a strong DevOps background, I'm excited by your work in e-commerce and data analytics and eager to contribute to your fast-growing team.

Kind regards,

Tim Stephenson
