## Problem

flowable 6 rest image is using almost all of 4gb ram on K8s cluster

## Solution

GitHub action to sync upstream, build aot complied image, deploy, regression test and swap it existing implementation

## Because:

 1. Flowable 7 required for spring 3 (aot compilation) and not published by upstream
 2. Not confident to move from flowable 6 to 7 due to lack of regression testing 
 
## Steps

Regression testing first or build first?

Is there any point regression testing existing? Only if it is a stepping stone to upgrade. 

## 2025-05-22

1. Latest release = 7.1.0 Oct 24 and it does publish a rest variant (non-native)
