# RealWorld front end in React
Links:

* https://github.com/angelguzmaning/ts-redux-react-realworld-example-app[React using hooks + Redux]
** "This project was bootstrapped with https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app[Create React App], using the Redux and Redux Toolkit template."
** But Create React App says it closed in 2021 and "we recommend that you migrate to one of React frameworks documented on https://react.dev/learn/creating-a-react-app[Start a New React Project]."
** Apparently 'React is a library' eventually got what it deserved and 'full stack frameworks' are the way to go with https://nextjs.org/docs[Next.js (from Vercel)] top of the list.

## Getting started (with Next.js)

## React from scratch

https://react.dev/learn/build-a-react-app-from-scratch

* `npm create vite@latest  -- --template react`

* https://transform.tools/html-to-jsx[HTML to JSX]
* Copied the templates required for conduit into index.html and App.jsx

* Asked copilot: 

  > Use Authorization header "Token eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJkZW1vQGRlbW8uY29tIiwiZXhwIjoxNzUxNDUzODYyfQ.4o6iPC_sJ8VXy8titbmlRoM9iCToO5Rvq7IhjA81Q5o" and SWR state management library to fetch data from http://localhost:8000/api/articles?limit=20

  Successful. Not only added the dependency and implemented the SWR fetcher but replaced the templated articles with a new ArticleList function and populated it from the data returned!

* https://reactrouter.com/start/data/custom[React router]
* Prompt:

> Please implement the react router and add a new route /login

  Incredibly it seemed to find the login page template more or less identical to the expected one (couple of differenvces like button had type=submit)

* Prompt

> On submit of login form POST to http://localhost:8000/users/login. request body should be {
"user": {
"email": "demo@demo.com",
"password": "demo"
}
}

  Result looks promising, though I noted it had not clocked that POST url was same as the fetch for articles.

  Accepted its offer to continue with 
  > yes please save the login token and redirect to / route

  then
  > AUTH_TOKEN on line 9 should be replaced the the token from local storage

  Small hiccup--and it was mine--login url should have contained /api.
